# Kinexis - Webcam-Based PT Recovery Tracking

## 🎯 Hackathon Project: October 24-26, 2025

### Quick Summary
Kinexis uses a standard webcam and computer vision to track patient movement during physical therapy exercises. It provides real-time visual feedback to patients and generates professional reports for insurance claims.

### The Pitch
- 💰 $100 webcam replaces $5,000+ motion capture equipment
- ⏱️ 2 minutes per patient vs. 10-15 minutes with manual measurements
